There does appear to be a statisitically significant results between the experimental and control groups with a p-value far below that of our standard alpha. There is a 3% higher conversion rate in our experimentral group. Whether that is enough for the business stakeholder to make changes could be up for further discussion and analysis. "

    "In this lab, you continued to get more practice designing and conducting AB tests. This required additional work preprocessing and formulating the initial problem in a suitable manner. Additionally, you also saw how to verify results, strengthening your knowledge of binomial variables, and reviewing initial statistical concepts of the central limit theorem, standard deviation, z-scores, and their accompanying p-values."
